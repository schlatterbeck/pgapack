Updated March 2020:
- Add restricted tournament replacement, see updated user guide for
  details and references
- Fix some compiler warnings
- Implement Tournament Selection with more than 2 individuals, new
  parameter settable with PGASetTournamentSize, the default is the old
  default of 2.

Updated Sept 2017: new installation instructions, availability:
- Bug fixes in MPI code: Now compiles against all MPI implementations
  shipped with Debian Linux (openmpi, mpich, lam).
- Bug fix in PGAChange that did not call PGASetEvaluationUpToDateFlag:
  This would result in occasional wrong evaluation of individuals,
  noteably the evaluation went *down* with a elitist strategy.
- Bug fix for restart with an integer gene: According to the user guide
  this should use PGA_MUTATION_CONSTANT but tried to use
  PGA_MUTATION_UNIFORM which is undefined for integer genes
- Start fixing the user guide with new documentation, the old original
  postscript is still available. Notably documentation bugs reported via
  the debian project were fixed. The user guide can be built from source
  again (after probably a *very* long time).
- Make fortran compile again

[ Updated March 2008:  
  -- the original README, minus two references to the now 
     obsolete website and mailing lists, follows below
  -- PGAPack has also been built successfully against LAM/MPI 
     and Open MPI. ]

Introduction
============
PGAPack is a general-purpose, data-structure-neutral, parallel genetic
algorithm library developed at Argonne National Laboratory.  
Key features are:

* Callable from Fortran or C.
* Runs on uniprocessors, parallel computers, and workstation networks.
* Binary-, integer-, real-, and character-valued native data types.
* Object-oriented data structure neutral design. 
* Parameterized population replacement.
* Multiple choices for selection, crossover, and mutation operators.
* Easy integration of hill-climbing heuristics. 
* Easy-to-use interface for novice and application users.
* Fully extensible to support custom operators and new data types.
* Extensive debugging facilities.
* A large set of example problems.


Availability
============
PGAPack is freely available.  Older versions of the distribution are
available by anonymous ftp from from ftp.mcs.anl.gov in the directory
pub/pgapack. The distribution contains all source code, installation
instructions, users guide, and a collection of examples in C and
Fortran. 
The latest version can be obtained from github at
https://github.com/schlatterbeck/pgapack


Computational Environment
=========================
PGAPack is written in ANSI C and uses the MPI message passing interface
and should run on most uniprocessors, parallel computers, and workstation
networks.  PGAPack has been tested on the workstations and parallel computers 
specified by the ARCH_TYPE variable below.


Documentation
=============
* The PGAPack users guide is in ./docs/user_guide.ps after building the
  guide from sources (see Makefile). The old original version was
  preserved as docs/user_guide-orig.ps -- it is recommended to use the
  latest version that had some fixes.
* Man pages for PGAPack functions are in the ./man directory.
* Installation instructions are in this README file and the users guide.
  Note that the installation instructions in the user guide are
  obsolete.
* Example problems are in the ./examples directory.


Installation Requirements
=========================
To compile you must have an ANSI C compiler that includes a full
implementation of the Standard C library and related header files.  To build a
*parallel* version of PGAPack you must provide an implementation of MPI
(Message Passing Interface) for the parallel computer or workstation network
you are running on.

Most of our testing and development was done using MPICH, a freely available
implementation of MPI.  MPICH runs on many parallel computers and
workstation networks and is publicly available and free.  The complete
distribution is available by anonymous ftp from ftp.mcs.anl.gov.  Take the
file mpich.tar.Z from the directory pub/mpi.  Additional information about
MPICH is avaliable on the World Wide Web at http://www.mcs.anl.gov/mpi.

In addition to MPICH, the current installation was compiled successfully
with openmpi and lam.

Installation Instructions
=========================
When installing PGAPack you make two choices: whether to build a sequential
(the default) or parallel version, and whether to build a debug or optimized
(the default) version.  In broad outline, the
installation steps are as follows.

1.  Check out from github
2.  Run

    make MPI=$MPIVERSION

    replacing $MPIVERSION with either serial, openmpi, mpich, or lam
    If this doesn't work, you can specify MPI_LIB and/or MPI_INCLUDE in
    addition.
    The original targets of the old configure were preserved for
    historical reasons, so you may want to build with:

    make ARCH_TYPE=$ARCHITECTURE

    replacing ARCHITECTURE with one of the following:

    sun4           for Sun SparcStations workstations,
    next           for NeXT workstations,
    rs600          for IBM RS6000 workstations,
    irix           for Silicon Graphics workstations,
    hpux           for Hewlett Packard workstations,
    alpha          for DEC Alpha workstations,
    linux          for machines running Linux,
    freebsd        for machines running FreeBSD,
    generic        for generic 32-bit machines, 
    powerchallenge for the Silicon Graphics Power Challenge Array,
    challenge      for the Silicon Graphics Challenge,
    t3d            for the Cray T3D,
    sp2            for the IBM SP2,
    paragon        for the Intel Paragon, or
    exemplar       for the Convex  Exemplar.

    The full make options are ARCH_TYPE, CC,
    CFLAGS, FC, FFLAGS, DEBUG, MPI_INC, MPI_LIB

    where all parameters are optional and do the following:

    CC:       The name of the ANSI C compiler, cc by default.
    CPPFLAGS: C Preprocessor flags (later appended to CFLAGS)
    CFLAGS:   Options passed to the C compiler.
    DEBUG:    If specified, enables the debugging features
              and compiles the source code with the -g flag.
    FC:       The name of the Fortran 77 compiler, f77 by default.
              (The Fortran compiler is used only to compile the Fortran
              examples in the [./examples/] directory.)
    FFLAGS:   Options passed to the Fortran compiler.
    INCLUDES  Include options (usually -I directory) but see the MPI_INC
              below
    LDFLAGS:  Linker options
    LIBS:     Additional libraries, note that you probably have to
              include the math library with -lm
    MPI       Specify one of the known MPI types, one of openmpi, mpich,
              lam, or serial (for a non-MPI implementation)
    MPI_INC:  The Include-Option where MPI include files are located.
    MPI_LIB:  The Linker options for the MPI library, can also be the
              library file to link.
    OPT:      The optimization option your compiler understands
    SHAREDLIBS: If set to something different from "yes" will not build
              shared libraries

    If the MPI or MPI_INC, MPI_LIB options are specified, a parallel version 
    of PGAPack will be built, unless you explicitly specify MPI=serial.
    If these flags are not specified, a rudimentary check for a default
    MPI installation is done. If no MPI installation is found, a sequential
    version of PGAPack will be built.

    Note that older versions required to set the WL (word length)
    preprocessor define. This is no longer required, unless you have a
    very unusual machine where the C-expression

    sizeof(unsigned long) * 8

    is not the number of bits in an unsigned long (e.g. if you have a
    different size of character).

3.  Add PGAPack's man pages to your man page path.
    (setenv MANPATH "$MANPATH"":/home/pgapack/man")
4.  Execute a simple test problem
    
    Sequential version
    ------------------
    C:        /usr/local/pga/examples/c/maxbit
    Fortran:  /usr/local/pga/examples/fortran/maxbit

    Parallel version
    ------------------
    C:        mpirun -np 4 /usr/local/pga/examples/c/maxbit
    Fortran:  mpirun -np 4 /usr/local/pga/examples/fortran/maxbit

    If a parallel version of PGAPack was used, the actual commands to execute 
    a parallel program depend on the particular MPI implementation and
    parallel computer.  If the MPICH implementation was used the "mpirun"
    command can be used to execute a parallel program on most systems.



PGAPack on PCs 
===================
PGAPack has not been ported to MS-DOS, Windows 3.1, Windows 95, or Apple OS.
As mentioned earlier, however, PGAPack is written in ANSI standard C and
should compile in these environments.  Be aware, however, that PGAPack's
random number generator, PGARandom01, assumes certain machine characteristics
for ints and floats that may not correspond with what your PC and/or compiler
support, resulting in erroneous values.
