Multiobjective Example
======================

This directory contains C source code of multiobjective problems
from the NSGA-III papers by Kalyanmoy Deb and Himanshu Jain [1]_ [2]_.
The problems are described in another paper [4]_.

I've also used implementation notes from [3]_ and implemented the idea
of reference directions [5]_. Note that we're using only 3 objectives to
be able to plot the results (and because we're using it for regression
testing which shouldn't use too much time).

The multi-objective problems *with* constraints [2]_ are also implemented.

There is a small python script ``crowdingplot`` (in ``../nsgaii``) which
can be used to do a 3D-scatter-plot of three objective (in objective
space) using the ``-3`` option (for three dimensions).
